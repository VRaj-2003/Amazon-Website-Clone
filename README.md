This project is a basic clone of the global Amazon homepage, built entirely with HTML and CSS.

Features:

Layout: Mimics the standard Amazon homepage layout with header, navigation bar, hero section, product listings, and footer.
Navigation: Includes basic navigational links for key sections like Departments, Today's Deals, and global language selection. (Note: Links won't be functional)
Product Listings: Showcases a sample product grid layout with placeholders for images and titles.
Visual Design: Uses CSS to replicate basic Amazon branding elements and a clean, user-friendly aesthetic.
Limitations:

Non-Functional Links: Navigation links are for display only and won't lead to actual pages.
No Shopping Functionality: This is a purely static clone with no shopping cart or product interaction.
Limited Responsiveness: May require additional coding for optimal display across all devices.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone https://github.com/VRaj-2003/Amazon-Website-Clone to download the project files.
Open in Browser: Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the clone.
